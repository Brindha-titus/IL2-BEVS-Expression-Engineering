This repository contains my complete submission for Target-X (Human IL-2 precursor) expression strategy design using a Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) in Sf9/Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells, with the gene cloned between BamHI and XhoI sites in a shuttle vector. The project includes a full engineering workflow: sequence validation by NCBI BLASTP (confirming Target-X as IL-2; UniProt P60568.1), signal peptide identification (native human signal peptide detected), and a secretion-focused expression design using the gp67 insect secretion leader for improved extracellular recovery.

Codon optimization was performed specifically for Sf9/Sf21 to maximize translational efficiency while maintaining the exact amino acid sequence, avoiding rare codons, repeats, and extreme GC%. Computational analysis was implemented in Python (Biopython ProtParam) to calculate MW, pI, GRAVY, and instability index, and to automatically parse the signal peptide and mature protein. A simple aggregation-risk screening algorithm was included to flag ≥4 consecutive hydrophobic residues, which identified a candidate hotspot at residues 112–115 (VIVL) in the mature IL-2 sequence. Structural mapping in PyMOL confirmed this region forms a surface-exposed hydrophobic patch, supporting a rational solubility mutation (I113T) to disrupt the patch and reduce aggregation risk without affecting the overall fold.

The final construct recommendation includes gp67 leader + IL-2 mature domain + TEV site + C-terminal His₆ tag, enabling secretion into the medium and purification by IMAC (Ni-NTA) followed by optional tag removal and SEC polishing (Superdex 75). The repository includes the final report (.docx), the full Python source code, and terminal execution outputs required for reproducibility.
